[WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) plugin that extends the JSON REST [WP API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API) with new routes pointing to WordPress registered menus. Read the [WP API documentation](http://wp-api.org/).

#### New routes available:

- `/menus` list of every registered menu.
  - (V2 only:) `item` argument whether to fetch the menu items. Default: `false`
- `/menus/<menu>` data for a specific menu. Takes either an id, a name or a slug. Note that v1 only supports ids.
- `/menu-locations` list of all registered theme locations.
- `/menu-locations/<location>` data for menu in specified menu in theme location.

Currently, the `menu-locations/<location>` route for individual menus will return a tree with full menu hierarchy, with correct menu item order and listing children for each menu item. The `menus/<id>` route will output menu details and a flat array of menu items. Item order or if each item has a parent will be indicated in each item attributes, but this route won't output items as a tree.

You can alter the data arrangement of each individual menu items and children using the filter hook `json_menus_format_menu_item`.

#### WP API V2

In V1 of the REST API the routes are located by default at `wp-json/menus/` etc.

In V2 the routes by default are at `wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/` (e.g. `wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/`, etc.) since V2 encourages prefixing and version namespacing.
